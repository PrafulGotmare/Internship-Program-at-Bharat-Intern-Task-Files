Try to create a model with a linear regressor.
Linear regression (LR) is a strong machine-learning method that can effectively forecast housing values. 
We may create a beneficial tool for the real estate industry by collecting and preprocessing important data, constructing and fine-tuning the model, and assessing its performance. 
As technology progresses, machine learning models such as linear regression continue to revolutionize the way we make decisions, transforming data into useful insights for a better future.
